This is a Chess game implemented in Typescript.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

    .
    ├── backend/ 
    │   └── ...                                         # Backend files (current)
    │
    ├── frontend-ts/ 
    │   └── ...                                         # Frontend files (current)
    │
    └── frontend/ 
        └── ...                                         # frontend js files (old)


## Running the Backend with local Node.js

## Requirements

To run the game, you need to have either Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Running the Backend

Firstly navigate to the backend directory:

```sh
cd backend
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run the following command to start the server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Running the Frontend

Firstly navigate to the frontend-ts directory:

```sh
cd frontend-ts
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run the following command to start the server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server. Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to the URL that the server is running on (usually http://localhost:5173 or similar). The game should load in your browser.
